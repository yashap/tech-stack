Just me following a Udemy course on React Native, creating a sample app.

## Dev Workflow

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
If you've never used Create React Native App before, follow their instructions to get your dev environment set up.

Once you do, common dev workflow includes:

```bash
yarn             # install packages
yarn test        # run the unit tests
yarn start       # start a dev server, with hot reloading, that you can access from an actual phone
yarn run ios     # start a dev server, with hot reloading, that you can access from an iOS emulator
yarn run android # start a dev server, with hot reloading, that you can access from an Android emulator
```
